# Pragma Floating
Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the contract system negatively.

# Unsafe ERC20 Operations
Contracts are using ```.approve``` and ```.transferFrom()```.
### Impact
ERC20 operations can be unsafe due to different implementations and vulnerabilities in the standard.
It is therefore recommended to always either use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library or at least to wrap each operation in a require statement.
To circumvent ERC20's approve functions race-condition vulnerability use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library's safe{Increase|Decrease}Allowance functions.
In case the vulnerability is of no danger for your implementation, provide enough documentation explaining the reasonings.
