1. Consider addings checks for signature malleability

Use OpenZeppelin's ECDSA contract rather than calling ecrecover() directly

2. Use two-phase ownership transfers

Consider adding a two-phase transfer, where the current owner nominates the next owner, and the next owner has to call accept*() to become the new owner. This prevents passing the ownership to an account that is unable to use it.

3. Use of floating pragma

Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the contract system negatively.
