# Functions that are not called within the contract must set its visibility to `external` instead of `public`

## Details
Setting function's visibility to external when it is only called externally can save gas because external functionâ€™s parameters are not copied into memory and are instead read from calldata directly.
see reference: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro-findings/issues/37

## Mitigation
Set function visibility to `external`

# `!=` is cheaper in gas compared to `>` for uint

## Details
`!= 0` costs less gas compared to `> 0` for unsigned integers in require statements with the optimizer enabled (6 gas)
see reference: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-maple-findings/issues/75

## Mitigation
use `!= 0` instead of `> 0`

# Breaking down multiple `require` statements instead of using `&&`

## Details
Require statements including conditions with the && operator can be broken down in multiple require statements to save gas.
See reference: [G-09] of https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-04-backd/

## Mitigation
I suggest breaking down two conditions into two `require` statement instead of using `&&`. Example:
Changing from:
```
require(_escrow != address(0) && Address.isContract(_escrow), "INVALID_ESCROW");
```
to:
```
require(_escrow != address(0), "INVALID_ESCROW");
require(Address.isContract(_escrow), "INVALID_ESCROW");
```
