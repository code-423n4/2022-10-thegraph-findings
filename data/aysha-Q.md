Unlocked pragma
Contracts should be deployed using the same compiler version/flags with which they have been tested. Locking the pragma (for e.g. by not using ^ in pragma solidity 0.5.10) ensures that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using an older compiler version with unfixed bugs.

Solidity versions
Using very old versions of Solidity prevents benefits of bug fixes and newer security checks. Using the latest versions might make contracts susceptible to undiscovered compiler bugs. https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#incorrect-versions-of-solidity
==========================================================

Multiple Solidity pragma
It is better to use one Solidity compiler version across all contracts instead of different versions with different bugs and security checks.

Two-step change of privileged roles
When privileged roles are being changed, it is recommended to follow a two-step approach: 1) The current privileged role proposes a new address for the change 2) The newly proposed address then claims the privileged role in a separate transaction. This two-step change allows accidental proposals to be corrected instead of leaving the system operationally with no/malicious privileged role. For e.g., in a single-step change, if the current admin accidentally changes the new admin to a zero-address or an incorrect address (where the private keys are not available), the system is left without an operational admin and will have to be redeployed.

ERC20 approve() race condition
Use safeIncreaseAllowance() and safeDecreaseAllowance() from OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeERC20 implementation to prevent race conditions from manipulating the allowance amounts.

Missing zero address validation
Setters of address type parameters should include a zero-address check otherwise contract functionality may become inaccessible or tokens burnt forever. (see here)
