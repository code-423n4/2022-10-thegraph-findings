1. Splitting `require()` statements that use && save gas

see https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-xdefi-findings/issues/128 which describes the fact that there is a larger deployment gas cost, but with enough runtime calls, the change ends up being cheaper

2. Useage of uint / int smaller than 32 bytes incurs overhead

When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

3. use `abi.encodepacked` for gas optimization

Changing the `abi.encode` function to `abi.encodePacked` can save gas since the `abi.encode` function pads extra null bytes at the end of the call data, which is unnecessary. Also, in general, `abi.encodePacked` is more gas-efficient.

4.  `require()`/`revert()` strings longer than 32 bytes cost extra gas

Each extra chunk of byetes past the original 32 which costs 3 gas.
