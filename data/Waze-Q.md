## Recommendation
Checking addresses against zero-address during initialization in initialize is a security best-practice. However, such checks are missing in multiple initialize.â€¨ Allowing zero-addresses will lead to contract reverts and force redeployments if there are no setters for such address variables. So we recommend to Add zero-address checks in the  initialize.

## [L-02] Missing check zero address for setAdmin

## Recommendation
To ensure the newAdmin isn't zero address. wes recommend to add simple check for address(0).

## [L-03] prevent invalid destination address
## Code Snipped

## Recommendation
make sure the destinaton address is valid to avoid failure transfer. wes recommend to add check for address(0) _to
like this:

     require(_to != address(0), "INVALID_DESTINATION");

## [N-01] Missing indexed field

## Recommendation
event is missing indexed fields in important parameter regarding the address. we recommend indexed at important field for increase creadibility.

## [N-02] natspec incomplete

## Recommendation
the file has a natspec comment  to explain utility about function or parameter. but in these file the natspec comment incomplete. So we recommend to complete the natspec comment to increase readability and make it easier when there is an audit.

## Recommendation
In the contracts, floating pragmas should not be used. Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the contract system negatively.
We suggest to recheck your file and update the pragma.
