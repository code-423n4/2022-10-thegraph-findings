## USE A MORE RECENT VERSION OF SOLIDITY : < 0.8
Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.2 to get simple compiler automatic inlining 
Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.3 to get better struct packing and cheaper multiple storage reads 
Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.4 to get custom errors, which are cheaper at deployment than revert()/require() strings 
Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.10 to have external calls skip contract existence checks if the external call has a return value
