1. Copying state struct in memory is wrong and wastes gas

Using storage pointer instead of memory location can save a decent amount of gas.

2. != is more efficient than > in require statements and saves gas.

!= 0 costs less gas compared to > 0 for unsigned integers in require statements with the optimizer enabled (6 gas)

For uints the minimum value would be 0 and never a negative value. Since it cannot be a negative value, then the check > 0 is essentially checking that the value is not equal to 0 therefore >0 can be replaced with !=0 which saves gas.
